## What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is a way of writing down the steps of a program without worrying about the exact programming language.  

It uses **structured English** and looks a bit like code, but it is not meant to run on a computer.  

We use pseudocode to show the **design** of a program before we write it in Python or another language.  

## Key Rules

- Pseudocode is written in simple, structured English.
- Variables should have **sensible names**.
- Arithmetic and string operations are written in standard symbols.


## Why Use Pseudocode?

- Easy to read.  
- Works the same no matter what language you use later.  
- Good for explaining ideas in exams.  

## Example

```pseudocode
Main Steps

1 Enter valid temperatures for each day of the week and calculate the total
2 Calculate the average temperature
3 Work out if the average temperature is above or below freezing
4 Display all results

Refinements

1.1 totalTemp = 0
1.2 start fixed loop 7 times
1.3 enter dailyTemp
1.4 while dailyTemp < -50 or dailyTemp > 50
1.5     display "Invalid, temperature must be between -50 and 50"
1.6     re-enter dailyTemp
1.7 end while
1.8 totalTemp = totalTemp + dailyTemp
1.9 end fixed loop

2.1 averageTemp = totalTemp / 7
2.2 round averageTemp to 1 decimal place

3.1 if averageTemp < 0
3.2     message = "The week was below freezing on average"
3.3 else
3.4     message = "The week was above freezing on average"
3.5 end if

4.1 start fixed loop 7 times
4.2 display each dailyTemp
4.3 end fixed loop
4.4 display totalTemp
4.5 display averageTemp
4.6 display message
```
