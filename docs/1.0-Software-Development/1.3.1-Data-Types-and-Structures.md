!!! info "What you Need to Know"

    __You must be able to identify__ the data types and structures required for a problem that relates to the implementation at this level.

## Data Structures

At National 5, the two data structures you need to know are:

- **Variable** – stores a single value (e.g. age = 15)
- **Array** – stores multiple values of the same type (e.g. scores = [14, 18, 20])

__You must be able to identify both as data structures in the exam.__

__Variables__

A __variable__ is used to __store a single value__ during the running of a program. 

Although a __variable__ only holds one value, it is still considered a data structure because it stores data in a __named place in memory__.

``` python title="Variables" linenums="1"
name1 = ("Alice")
name2 = ("Ben")
name3 = ("Carla")
name4 = ("David")
name5 = ("Eilidh")
```

Even though it holds only one value, the SQA considers a __variable__ to be a __data structure__, because it is a named place in memory where data is stored.

__Arrays__

At National 5, the 2nd most common structure you will use is an __array__ (also called a list).

An array lets you store many values in one place. For example, if you wanted to store the names of five pupils, instead of creating five separate variables, you could use one array:

``` python title="Arrays" linenums="1"
names = ["Alice", "Ben", "Carla", "David", "Eilidh"]
```

## Data Types

Data types are important when programming. The computer has to know whether to expect numbers, text, or other types of values. 

There are five data types you must know for National 5:

<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Data Type</th>
      <th>Used For</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Integer</td>
      <td>Whole numbers (positive or negative), e.g. 7, -12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Real</td>
      <td>Numbers with decimal places, e.g. 3.14, -0.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Boolean</td>
      <td>True or False values, often used in decisions or conditions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Character</td>
      <td>A single letter, number, or symbol, e.g. 'A', '3', '?'</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>String</td>
      <td>Text made up of multiple characters, e.g. "Hello123!"</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</center>

__If you are given an example, you need to be able to say which data type it belongs to.__

<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Example Value</th>
      <th>Data Type</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>"Ella"</td>
      <td>String</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>15</td>
      <td>Integer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>15.5</td>
      <td>Real</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>True</td>
      <td>Boolean</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</center>

!!! example

    > You have been asked to create a program that asks the user for the names and ages of everyone in the class.

    > When finished, it displays a message saying how many people are in the class, and their average age.
    
    If you were asked to explain the data types used in this program, in the exam, you would say something like:

    * The __names__ are __strings__, because they are __text__
    
    * The __ages__ are __integers__, e.g. someone is __15__ years old
    
    * The number of people in the class is an __integer__, because you can’t have `0.5` of a person
    
    * The average is a real number because it might include a decimal point.

    The last point is really important - quite often, you could be asked to calculate an average. 
    
    Think about it yourself - if three people are 15, 15 and 16, those are integers - but the average is 15.333, a real number.

    Remember to fully think through the problems!

__These data types are really important — you’ll use and discuss them in every program, and being confident with them will really help you in the exam__.
